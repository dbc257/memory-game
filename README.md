## :dizzy: MEMORY CARD GAME :dizzy:

Memory Card Game was created using React.js, CSS, and React Bootstrap. It allows the user to play the Memory Game using 16 cards. After the user matches all of the 8 pairs of cards, they can start a new game via the modal that pops up after the user wins the game. The user can also start a new game by pressing the Reset Game button at the bottom of the page.
